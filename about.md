My name is Abe Anderson. I currently reside in the city of Pittsburgh, PA. I'm an aspiring Software-Engineer & Web-Developer. I also have a degree in Creative & Professional Writing from Carnegie Mellon University - which I sometimes use. I play drums for [Chet Vincent & The Big Bend](http://thebigbend.net/) and I've got a hugely awesome huge dog.
